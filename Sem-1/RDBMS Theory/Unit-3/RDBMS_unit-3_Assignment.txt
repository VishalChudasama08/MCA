Q - 3 Answer The Following Questions.
11. Define the first normal form to normalize the database.
12. Define the term Cardinality
13. Define "Deletion Anomalies" with suitable example.
14. Normalize the given relation: BRANCH (Branch#, Branch_Addr, ISBN, Title, Authaor, Publisher, Num_copies) and give explanation for decomposition of the relation to convert it into 2nd normal form. 
  Consider few functional dependancies like Branch# -> ISBN, ISBN -> Title, {Branch#, ISBN} -> Num_Copies
15. Convert the following database schema in 3NF.
  Emp (SSN, Birth_Date, Department, Proj_Manager, Proj_Handled)
  Here it is to be assumes that one employee will work for one department only but can handle multiple projects and for each project there with be a project 
  manager(another employee from same or different department).
  
OR

15. Convert the following relation into 3NF and then BCNF. Explain the difference between both normal forms.
  R = {Property_ID, City, Plot_No, Area, Price}
  Functional Dependencies are given as below:
  FD1: Property_ID -> {City, Plot_No, Area, Price}
  FD2: {City, Plot_No} -> {Property_ID, Area, Price}
  FD3: Area -> Price
  FD4: Area -> City
  
  
  
Q - 3 Answer The Following Questions.
11. Define "Multivalued Functional Dependency" with appropriate example
12. Define any two Armstrongâ€™s axioms/properties of functional dependencies.
13. Define Codd's "Foundation Rule" and "Information Rule" for a database to be the correct RDBMS.
14. What is Normalization? Explain 1NF, 2NF with suitable example. =>3
15. What is Anomalies? Define Insert, Update and Delete Anomalies with suitable example. =>4

OR

15. Consider the following relation and its functional dependencies. Assume that the relation is in 1NF and convert the relation in 2NF and 3NF with the rules for each decomposition.
  R = {Proj#, Proj_Name, Emp#, Emp_Name, Job_Class, Chg_Per_Hr, Hours}
  FD1: {Proj#, Emp#} -> Hours 
  FD2: {Job_Class} -> {Chg_Per_Hr}
