Q - 3 Answer The Following Questions.
11. Define the first normal form to normalize the database.
=> 
  A relation is in First Normal Form (1NF) if all attributes contain only atomic (indivisible) values and each record has a unique identifier (primary key).
  ðŸ‘‰ In simple terms:
    â–¶ No repeating groups or arrays.
    â–¶ Each cell of the table holds a single value only.
    â–¶ Each row is unique.


12. Define the term Cardinality
=>
  Cardinality in a database refers to the number of instances of one entity that can be associated with the number of instances of another entity in a relationship.
  ðŸ‘‰ Types:
    â–¶ One-to-One (1:1)
    â–¶ One-to-Many (1:N)
    â–¶ Many-to-Many (M:N)


13. Define "Deletion Anomalies" with suitable example.
=>
  A deletion anomaly occurs when the deletion of a record unintentionally causes loss of valuable data that should have been retained.
  Example: 
  StudentID	StudentName	Course
  1	        Ajay	      Math
  2	        Meera	      Science
  If Ajay is the only student enrolled in Math and we delete his record, information about the Math course is also lost.


14. Normalize the given relation: BRANCH (Branch#, Branch_Addr, ISBN, Title, Author, Publisher, Num_copies) and give explanation for decomposition of the relation to convert it into 2nd normal form. 
  Consider few functional dependancies like Branch# -> ISBN, ISBN -> Title, {Branch#, ISBN} -> Num_Copies
=>
  Second Normal Form (2NF):
  A relation is in 2nd Normal Form if it is already in First Normal Form (1NF) and there are no partial dependencies.
  partial dependencies: all non-prime attributes are functionally dependent on the whole candidate key
  Keys: {Branch#}
  BRANCH_INFO(Branch#, Branch_Addr, ISBN)
  BOOK(ISBN, Title, Author, Publisher)
  STOCK(Branch#, ISBN, Num_Copies)

15. Convert the following database schema in 3NF.
  Emp (SSN, Birth_Date, Department, Proj_Manager, Proj_Handled)
  Here it is to be assumes that one employee will work for one department only but can handle multiple projects and for each project there with be a project 
  manager(another employee from same or different department).
=>
  1NF: All attributes atomic 1NF satisfied.
  2NF: A relation is already in First Normal Form (1NF) and there are no partial dependencies.
  partial dependencies: all non-prime attributes are functionally dependent on the whole candidate key
  keys- 
  3NF: A relation is already in Second Normal Form (2NF) and there are no transitive dependency.
  transitive dependency: non-key attribute dependent on another non-key attribute that is transitive dependency.

  
OR

15. Convert the following relation into 3NF and then BCNF. Explain the difference between both normal forms.
  R = {Property_ID, City, Plot_No, Area, Price}
  Functional Dependencies are given as below:
  FD1: Property_ID -> {City, Plot_No, Area, Price}
  FD2: {City, Plot_No} -> {Property_ID, Area, Price}
  FD3: Area -> Price
  FD4: Area -> City
  
  
  
Q - 3 Answer The Following Questions.
11. Define "Multivalued Functional Dependency" with appropriate example
12. Define any two Armstrongâ€™s axioms/properties of functional dependencies.
13. Define Codd's "Foundation Rule" and "Information Rule" for a database to be the correct RDBMS.
14. What is Normalization? Explain 1NF, 2NF with suitable example. =>3
15. What is Anomalies? Define Insert, Update and Delete Anomalies with suitable example. =>4

OR

15. Consider the following relation and its functional dependencies. Assume that the relation is in 1NF and convert the relation in 2NF and 3NF with the rules for each decomposition.
  R = {Proj#, Proj_Name, Emp#, Emp_Name, Job_Class, Chg_Per_Hr, Hours}
  FD1: {Proj#, Emp#} -> Hours 
  FD2: {Job_Class} -> {Chg_Per_Hr}
